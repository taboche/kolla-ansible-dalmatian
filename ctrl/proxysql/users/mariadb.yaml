# This configuration file is used to configure proxysql users,
# in our case we just define default_hostgroup and the mysql galera
# cluster group where user is routed to.
#
# This is used especially when services are creating databases, users
# and connects via user 'root_shard_SHARD_ID', so ProxySQL know
# where to route this query.
#
# Table mysql_users defines MySQL users that clients can use to connect to
# ProxySQL, and then used to connect to backends.
